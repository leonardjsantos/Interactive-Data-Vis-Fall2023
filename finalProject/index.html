    <h4>Tracking Art Pieces by Gender</h4>
    <div class="main">
      <p>For my final project, Iâ€™m visualizing the representation of artwork created by woman because I want to show the gender artist gap throughout the least couple of hundred years in order to show how women have been continuously underrepresented as artists throughout history. The way I would do this is by creating a line graph with the x-axis tracking time, the y-axis tracking the number of art projects created, and two separate lines that track the number of pieces created by men and the number of pieces created by women. My intended audience is students and scholars of women and gender studies, as well as anyone involved with funding art education programs to advocate for creating pathways for women to become professional artists.</p>
    
      <p>During the ideation session, I thought of creating this and made the following drawing:</p>

      <p>To illustrate my final product, I created the following graphic that I plan to code into my program.</p>
